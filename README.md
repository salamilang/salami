# ⛷️ slalom

Slalom is a workflow runtime for LLM-generated code. It is reactive, async, and resumable (e.g. you can pause the running thread, store it in a database, and restore it later when it's time to continue). It allows the code to be completed or edited in case of an error or incomplete specification.
